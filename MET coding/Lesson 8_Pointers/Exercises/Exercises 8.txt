Programming Exercises 1
1. Write a program that uses an array and that reads in the exam marks of a class (10 students) and
calculates the average class mark.
2. Write a program which reads 10 numbers into an array and then sorts the values from smallest
to largest.
3. Repeat exercise 2 only this time pass the array to a function which will do the sorting.
4. Write a program, using an array of integers with 2 functions, that will return the largest and
smallest value of the array.
5. Write a program which will fill an array with values for the function
y = x^2 + 6x -2 for x = 1
to 10 with step size 1.
6. Repeat exercise 5 for a range of values of -1 to 1 with a step size of 0.1.
7. Write a program that reads in the years monthly temperatures and calculates the average
temperature for the year. Calculate the standard deviation about the mean from the formula.
8. A vector is a mathematical object which is just an array of numbers eg v = (3,4,1) and u = (6,7,2)
are examples of three dimension vectors. Vector addition and multiplication are defined as
follows
v + u = (3+6,4+7,1+2) = (9,11,3)
v * u = 3*6 + 4*7 + 1*2 = ?
Write two functions, one that adds two vectors and one that multiplies two vectors.


Programming Exercises 2
1. Write a program that reads in and prints out your name and address into an array using the scanf
and printf functions.
2. Repeat 1 using gets and puts.
3. Write a short program that counts the number of letters in a persons name which they have type
in at the keyboard.
4. Write a program which reads in a line of text from the keyboard and also a character from the
keyboard, and then prints out the number of times that the character appeared in the line of
text.
5. Write a function that will capitalise all the characters in a string.
6. A matrix can be defined as a 2-dim array. Conside the matrices below
These are examples of 2x2 matrices. We can add/subtract and multiply matrices as defined
earlier. Write a program which allows the program user to enter the elements of two matrices
and also the operation +,- or * which they want to be performed on the matrices. Print the
results out in matrix form.
7. Write a program which prints out a table of values to be plotted by a graphics package of the
following function
y = -3 x + 11 for -10 < x < 10
,
8. Write a program in which the user enters 5 cities. The program should store them first and then
display them to the user.
