Programming Exercises 1
1. Write a program that uses an array and that reads in the exam marks of a class (10 students) and
calculates the average class mark.
2. Write a program which reads 10 numbers into an array and then sorts the values from smallest
to largest.
3. Repeat exercise 2 only this time pass the array to a function which will do the sorting.
4. Write a program, using an array of integers with 2 functions, that will return the largest and
smallest value of the array.
5. Write a program which will fill an array with values for the function
y = x^2 + 6x -2 for x = 1
to 10 with step size 1.
6. Repeat exercise 5 for a range of values of -1 to 1 with a step size of 0.1.
7. Write a program that reads in the years monthly temperatures and calculates the average
temperature for the year. Calculate the standard deviation about the mean from the formula.
8. A vector is a mathematical object which is just an array of numbers eg v = (3,4,1) and u = (6,7,2)
are examples of three dimension vectors. Vector addition and multiplication are defined as
follows
v + u = (3+6,4+7,1+2) = (9,11,3)
v * u = 3*6 + 4*7 + 1*2 = ?
Write two functions, one that adds two vectors and one that multiplies two vectors.
